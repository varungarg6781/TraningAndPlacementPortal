#Chapter 1

Introduction
This chapter provides an introduction to the project, motivation and criteria to achieve the objectives.

1.1 Project Outline
The Training and Placement Department  is dealing with Student Placements and Summer Training within MNNIT Allahabad.
The task is to build a T&P Process Management system  the Google mail and Google Groups, therefore the department wants to switch to an autfor this organization. Current Process Management system is full of redundancies and dependent onomated computerized process management system with a supporting Android App to send live updates and notifications.
After building this system we have to integrate it with the existing computerized system of Dean Academics for automatic information retrieval. Training and Placement management system is a web and Android application, enabling the department to handle placement records of students of MNNIT Allahabad.
The student eligible for the T&P Process are able to fill out all necessary information like email id, mobile no, matriculation marks and other relevant information. This system should be capable enough to retrieve the important and compulsory information of student from Dean Academics Database. On the basis of registration number, it will create a database of the student and will keep on updating it after every activity for which he has registered.
Finally, a college placement report can be produced with the help of database calculating mean, mode salary and present it graphically.

1.2 Motivation
All information such as student recruitment information, company contact info are being processed manually at the moment which is a time consuming task. At the same time there is no such portal for internship program. The notification process is often delayed and a person requires a Google Id and be a part of the Placement Group to get notification. Hence, a system is required that can perform all above said operations automatically. Moreover, the system should be user friendly, flexible, fast and highly secure.

1.3 Problem Identification
The department is  using a manual system to notify students regarding the placement activity and to generate reports with the same. They also have to send notifications manually using the Google mail. The management of organization also has to deal with bank files manually. All this work requires a lot of paperwork, is extremely time consuming job, and accordingly costly as well, as they have to hire more manpower. Since there is always a risk of human errors present in a manual system so the chances of errors are very high and to figure out such errors is also a very lengthy procedure. Therefore, the department decided to switch from a manual system to an automated computerized T&P Process management system. The requirement of the department is to develop a web based application that is able to deal with placement and training information of student within the department and maintain its data base. Furthermore this system should be able to generate automatic data reports such as, no. of students placed, average package received, CPI vs. Salary data report in response to the queries from the data stored in the database.

1.4 Customized Solution
The department required a customized solution. We will later on discuss in chapter 2, why is customized solution required? We will briefly study different softwares available for this domain in the market.

1.5 Project Goals
The system should be capable of performing following functions: 

• Store basic information regarding students of the college.
• Store placement information of students retrieved from Dean Academics like .
